# ðŸ§© Coding Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges and practice exercises, primarily from:

- [freeCodeCamp Daily Programming Challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive)
- Online courses and tutorials
- Other problem-solving platforms I explore

The purpose of this collection is to practice algorithmic thinking, strengthen problem-solving skills, and maintain a record of my coding journey.

Each solution file typically includes:
- A brief **problem description** (as a comment/docstring)
- The **implemented solution**
- (Optional) basic test cases

**Note:**
These solutions are primarily for learning and practice.
Code may be improved and refactored as I continue to grow as a developer.
